# mcscan-blast-binder
BOth MCscan software and command line-based BLAST available in a Jupyter environment running via the Binder service

This repo is meant to combine main software abilities of my [mcscan-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/mcscan-binder) and [blast-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/blast-binder) repos because for some workflows/pipelines it would be handy to have both running in same Jupyter session.  
See those individual repos for the information on the software and how to run each.
