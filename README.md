# mcscan-blast-binder
Both MCscan software and command line-based BLAST available in a Jupyter environment running via the Binder service

Python 2-focused repo because it is meant to combine main software abilities of my [mcscan-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/mcscan-binder) and [blast-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/blast-binder) repos. For some workflows/pipelines it would be handy to have both running in same Jupyter session.  
See those individual repos for the information on the software and how to use each.

Added nteract's [Papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill), too, to allow triggering specific notebooks to run with externally defined parameters; it is Python 2 compatible and I have verified it works here.
