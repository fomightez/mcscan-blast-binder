# mcscan-blast-binder
Both MCscan software and command line-based BLAST available in a Jupyter environment running via the Binder service

This repo is meant to combine main software abilities of my [mcscan-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/mcscan-binder) and [blast-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/blast-binder) repos because for some workflows/pipelines it would be handy to have both running in same Jupyter session.  
See those individual repos for the information on the software and how to use each.

Trying to add Papermill too. I believe is it is Python 2 compatible and so should work here.
